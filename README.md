# Advanced-shopping-cart
Welcome! This is a feature-rich shopping cart built with vanilla JavaScript—no frameworks, just clean, modern JS. 
It handles everything from adding items to keeping your cart saved even if you refresh the page. 
Perfect for learning or as a starting point for an e-commerce project.
# What It Can Do
Add and remove products from your cart

Adjust quantities (with real-time updates!)

Automatically calculates totals 

Keeps your cart saved using localStorage

Clean, responsive design

Modular and easy to expand
# Getting Started
You can get it up and running with just your browser:

# bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-cart.git
cd shopping-cart
open index.html
# How It Works
Products are loaded dynamically from a JSON file or API.

When you add a product, it updates the cart in real-time.

Your cart data is saved locally so it doesn’t disappear on refresh.

You can remove items or change quantities anytime.

Want to connect to a backend? It’s all ready for that too.

# Future Improvements
Here’s what we’d love to add next:

🔍 Product search and filtering

💳 Payment integration (e.g., Stripe)

🔐 User accounts and login

✅ Unit testing (Jest or similar)

🌐 Full backend with Node.js or Express
